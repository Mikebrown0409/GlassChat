# Project Requirements

The requirements for the Cloneathon, derived from the [Cloneathon website]([invalid url, do not cite]) and X posts, are as follows, with our compliance strategy:
Open-Source Mandate: Must be open-source with a permissive license (e.g., MIT), hosted on GitHub.

Action: We'll use MIT, as specified, and host on GitHub with detailed documentation (Prompt 14). This aligns with our tech stack's open-source ethos.

Age Eligibility: Participants must be 18+ to claim prizes.

Action: Assuming you meet this (please confirm), we proceed. If not, we'll focus on community impact for recognition, as per competition rules.

Functionality Baseline: Replicate T3 Chat's core features, including multi-model AI chat (e.g., GPT-4, Claude), fast UI, local-first storage with Dexie.js, and sync with Upstash Redis.

Action: Covered by Prompts 3-5, ensuring AI integration, local storage, and sync, with performance optimizations (Prompt 9).

Timeline: 10 days (June 7 - June 17, 2025, 12:00 PM PDT).

Action: Our 10-day workflow, adjusted to 9 days, 10 hours from now, is on track, with buffer time for polish.

Submission Format: GitHub repository link, live demo (e.g., Vercel), and optional video/PDF.

Action: Addressed in Prompt 15, with a cinematic video and PDF pitch highlighting vibes and benchmarks.
